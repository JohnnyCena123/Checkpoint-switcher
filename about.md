# Checkpoint switcher

This mod will allow you to switch between previously placed checkpoints (only practice mode at the moment, don't try using the mod on a platformer) however much you want!

It works much like a startpos switcher.

This mod is currently under development and is not finished, beware that it may cause crashes. If it does, **PLEASE SEND CRASHLOGS!!!**

## Features
- UI that allows you to immediately switch to any checkpoint, unlike most startpos switchers which require you to go one by one until you reach the one you want
- Soft toggle for the mod through the exact same UI mentioned above

### Coming soonâ„¢
- Previews - the mod will save a screenshot of the level each time you place a checkpoint, and you can view it in the mod's UI!
- Startpos switchers-like buttons UI
- Startpos switchers-like keybinds
- Ability to go back to the start of the level

## Credits

- CMNOG (@cmnog on discord) for the idea.
